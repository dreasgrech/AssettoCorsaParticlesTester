# Assetto Corsa Particle Effects
Particle Effects is a helper app for adding particle effects to tracks in Assetto Corsa.

Supports saving directly to the `ext_config.ini` global and layout specific files.

<br/>

To try out the work-in-progress version, create a directory called `AssettoCorsaParticleEffects` at `Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\apps\lua\AssettoCorsaParticleEffects` and copy all the files there (you can skip the `lib` directory)
